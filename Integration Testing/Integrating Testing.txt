3.	Integration Testing
In Integration testing, individual components of the software such as codes for different segments are combined and tested to check their working. So, after testing the various segments of use case “Borrow a Book”, we combined them and performed integration testing. It help to check that whether individual segment work or not when joined together.  
In this testing we combined (integrated) “BookDAO.java” and “Member.java” code with the “main.java” code. After integration, we tested the integrated code for checking the performance. We tested the both classes from the main using various parameters and noted their results. This helped us to understand the flow and sequence of the code. 
Main.java- From this class, first, we are creating object of the Member.java class to access its functions and then use this created object to create the members of the library. This will result in the integration of the modules with one another. We checked each function of the Member.java class in the Main.java. Similarly, we checked BookDAO.java class in the Main.java.
